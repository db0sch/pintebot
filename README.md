# PINTE BOT
Pinte bot is Slack bot telling you where you can find a good beer nearby.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Pinte Bot is made with Sinatra, Foursquare API, Recast and Geocoder.


=====

This Bot has been made with Sinatra just for the sake of it.
Rails (api flavored) would have been more suitable, but I wanted to build the stack for the bottom up.
It wasn't easy, but still I learned a lot.

Some of you will notice that I didn't use the 'modular' structure for Sinatra.
First, because I have only one route.
Second, because it seems like an overkill too me, when I read Sinatra: Up and Running.
And I wanted to build this app with my knowledge, and not following someone else structure.
I might be wrong. But I tried. :-)

We'll see...
